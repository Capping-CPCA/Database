**NOTE**: We have uploaded all the create table statements. Please take some time and review the database. Raise an issue if you see
something you think is wrong or see something we're are missing. Additionally, the issues can be questions as well.
We have also uploaded a PDF of documentation to go with our database so far. This is just a start and we will expanded it
